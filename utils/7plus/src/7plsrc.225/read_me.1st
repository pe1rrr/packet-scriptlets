- See 7plus.c for notes on how to compile.

- Don't forget to convert line seperators of the source code
  files to your system's requirements before trying to compile!!

- To unzip correctly on Unix/Linux: unzip -aa 7plxxxsr.zip
  Line seperators will automatically be converted to LF only.

- Current source code is available at http://home.t-online.de/~dg1bbq
