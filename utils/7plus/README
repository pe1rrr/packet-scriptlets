config.sh is meant to be a shared file for more scripts that may join
this collection for 7plus handling. the only shipped working script
so far is the encoder, located in the encode sub directory.

Edit config.sh to your desired path
However config.sh does presume that this 7plus directory will be put
in bpq's directory


pi7plus is a binary built from the 7plus source code also included
with this repo.
